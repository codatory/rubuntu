# Ubuntu / Ruby Development Environment Setup Script

## Run it
Copy and paste this snippet into your terminal as the user you want to use when it's done, it will use Sudo to get root if you aren't already root.

    wget -O - http://github.com/codatory/rubuntu/raw/master/ubuntu-bootstrap.sh | bash


## What is it?

This script will take a plain-old boring Ubuntu install from zero to ready-to-develop-on in just one easy step (and a lot of waiting). Just open up your terminal and paste the snippet above in and it will set to work.


## What do I get?

1. Vim + Janus
1. TMUX configured for pair programming (make_session and join_session commands)
1. System updates
1. RVM with REE
1. New SSH Key (so you can copy it around)
